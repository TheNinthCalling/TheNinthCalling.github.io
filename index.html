      <p>Hi yall! My name is Frankie, as the title of the website would suggest. I am a student at The University of Texas at Austin studying Electrical and Computer Engineering, with a focus in Software Engineering and Design. A mouthful, I know. Imagine having to say all that in person.</p>
      <p>If you're here then it's likely to figure out who I am, what drives me, and what I hope to accomplish: A simple answer would be that I want to be a software engineer working on projects that matter, driven by the opportunity to learn and grow. </p>
      <p>The other answer is that I don't quite know yet. I want to be a software engineer, a cybersecurity specialist, a data scientist, a game designer, a robotics expert, and so much more.<br><br>
      With that being said, software engineering and its practices are at the crux of every field. That is the field I have chosen and the one I plan to excel in.
      Besides, I sure am enjoying figuring it out, which is a great segway into taking a look at my projects below.<br><em>(p.s. The hackathon project was the most fun, albeit a work-in-progress.)<br>(p.s.s. Granted, the same goes for this website)</em></p>
