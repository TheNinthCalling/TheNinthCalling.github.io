      <p>Hi yall! My name is Frankie, as the title of the website would suggest. I am a student at The University of Texas at Austin studying Electrical and Computer Engineering, with a focus in Software Engineering and Design. A mouthful, I know. Imagine having to say all that in person.</p>
      <p>If you're here then it's likely to figure out who I am, what drives me, and what I hope to accomplish: A simple answer would be that I want to be a software engineer working on projects that matter, driven by the opportunity to learn and grow. </p>
      <p>The other answer is that I don't quite know yet. I want to be a software engineer, a cybersecurity specialist, a data scientist, a game designer, a robotics expert, and so much more.<br><br>
      With that being said, software engineering and its practices are at the crux of every field. That is the field I have chosen and the one I plan to excel in.
      Besides, I sure am enjoying figuring it out, which is a great segway into taking a look at my projects below.<br><em>(p.s. The hackathon project was the most fun, albeit a work-in-progress.)<br>(p.s.s. Granted, the same goes for this website)</em></p>

            <p>An innovative web platform designed to bridge the gap between budget-friendly travel and environmental responsibility. Carbon Flights offers travelers a unique experience with its interactive globe homepage. As users spin the globe and select destinations, the platform provides eco-friendly flight options. While the integration with Google APIs to pinpoint exact coordinates and nearby airports is still in progress, the platform's backend, built with Python and Flask, seamlessly interfaces with a MongoDB database.</p>
